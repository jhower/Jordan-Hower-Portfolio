## <center>Explanation
I am Jordan Hower and I am the sole creator of Bloc Jams. I started as a brand new web developer with this project.

---

## <center>Problem <br>
The biggest problem in developing a music site is the volume of your content. I had to figure out a solution to replace static HTML so there weren't massive amounts of code for each album and song within Bloc Jams.

---

## <center>Solution <br>
To replace static HTML I used dynamic JavaScript templates to eliminate repetitive code for each album and song. Using the DOM to make the site more user friendly with animation by using listeners, handlers, and events. Also in order to write less but do more it was important to use jQuery to simplify the site. Using the jQuery library also gives so many options to make the site look more aesthetically pleasing.
