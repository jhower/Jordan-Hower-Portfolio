My experience at Bloc has been eye opening. Bloc has taught me not only to code but how to think about how things work. I started with not really knowing much if anything about programming. I have had to take things slow in order to retain everything. My mentor Christine has been great being there as a support system teaching my how to thing and what approaches to take when I get stuck on a problem. She was so nice to even get permission for Bloc to pay the subscription to the Tree House site to really help me with understanding the material. I having to work full time and try to make sure to keep up with the path of completion has been a challenge. Putting in the hours each day, day after day is very beneficial to success. I am a visual learner and both Bloc and my mentor has recognized that and has given me the tools to learn and grow with my learning style. Overall it has been challenging but a great learning experience. I believe it is and will prepare me to become a developer and start a career. I am excited to move forward learn more and hone my skills through this process and am glad I chose the Bloc program to do so.
