I would say my biggest challenge while going thru the bloc program has been learning how to think as a developer and also conceptualizing large topics to make sense of the details. HTML and CSS are straightforward and cut and dry. My biggest challenge is JavaScript to make web pages dynamic. Personally the way I learn is an outside in approach I need to conceptualize and see the big picture. Once I can do that I can start to understand details and different aspects of those larger ideas. I really struggled in understanding JavaScript and being able to simplify code and understand what each piece of code does and what it interacts with. Also keeping my code organized and in the right formats has given me some trouble because at times its hard to read code especially when its not formatted correctly. Overall Bloc has been extremely challenging for a person who has never coded before. The more time, practice, and digging through code I do the better I am and the more confident I get with becoming a developer.
